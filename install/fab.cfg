[remote]

# if the destination file name differs from the source file
# you can override it here  in the form srcfile : remote file
# e.g. file1 : xfile
# you can also use it to specify a sub directory
# e.g. file1 : lib/file1 
# you may also specify an absolute path which will be used on its own
# without being appended to the basename
# e.g. file.cfg : /etc/file.cfg

# This section can also be overidden on a per host/role basis, by supplying 
# a section named [host] or [role] , host takes precdence over role
